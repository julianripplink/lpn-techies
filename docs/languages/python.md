# Welcome to the Python documentation!

## Recommended Tools
### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) was created specifically for Python, so pretty much everything you need to start coding is available by default. 

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is sleek and customizable, and supports many languages in addition to Python. It takes a bit of additional set-up, but it is also a very formidable IDE for Python. 

### Code formatter
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The uncompromising code formatter

> By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

### Pre-commit formatting changes
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) allows for automatic formatting changes when you commit your code. You can choose which formatting tools, or "hooks" you want to apply to your code. 

### Documentation
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) is an easy and visually appealing way to document your code. This documentation is made with Sphinx!

### API
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Huge benefit** - automatic interactive API documentation
